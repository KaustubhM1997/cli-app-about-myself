# How well do you know me?
A CLI app consisting of a quiz created using NodeJS in repl.it to know how much my network knows about me.

### How does the App work?

The quiz consists of MCQs where users would have to choose one of the options presented to them for a particular question. The user would get +1 for every correct answer and 0 for every incorrect answer chosen. Users would be able to see their scores at the end and also the highscores. If you all beat the high score, please send me a screenshot of the same over Twitter or LinkedIn and I'll update the database with your name and score.

The App also uses the CHALK library to make it look beautiful. To know more, head out to the ABOUT section above!
